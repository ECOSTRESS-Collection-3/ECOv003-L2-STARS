# ECOSTRESS Level 2 Vegetation Index & Albedo

This will be the repository for the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) collection 3 level 2 vegetation index and albedo data product algorithm.

The ECOSTRESS collection 3 level 2 vegetation index and albedo data product is the pre-cursor to the [Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) collection 1 level 2 vegetation index and albedo data product algorithm](https://github.com/sbg-tir/SBG-TIR-L2-STARS).
